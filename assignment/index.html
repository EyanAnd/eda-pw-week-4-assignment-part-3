    <ul>
      <li> I know that my listItems is 'undefined' because it does not have a return statement. I know it wasn't in the directions to make one. But what would you suggest we put as a return statement there? </ul>
      <li>For some weird reason I cannot console log within a function. I am still able to test my code in a roundabout way but this was not happening to me on the other assignments.</ul>
